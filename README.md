# Chrome Event Countdown API

A simple ( and very quickly hacked together ) API to get country, city and weather data for use by the chrome event countdown extension.

City & Country Data based off the basic datasource by [SimpleMaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) and [Geonames Cities 5000](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/)

Weather Data provided by [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev)
